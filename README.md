Getting and Cleaning Data Final Project


This code file includes manipulations performed ona data set of movement data recorded from a smartphone for the purposes of identifying movement behaviors performed by subjects wearing the smartphone devices. The code can be used load the data set into an R enviornment and extract information from the data for further analysis. 

The code can be used to do the following:

1. Load Data and Merge the Training and the Test sets to create one data set

2. Extract from our merged data set the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each movement measurement

3. Replace original Activity labels with descriptive labels

4. Label original data set variables with descriptive variable names

5. Create an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
